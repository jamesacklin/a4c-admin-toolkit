notes: |
  To mimick Internet Explorer's "clear" button for search fields, add a `.has-clear` class to the parent `.input-group`, then include the `.form-control-clear` icon with all the requesite classes. JavaScript support for this interactivity is included in `toolkit.js`.

<div class="input-group has-clear">
  <span class="input-group-addon"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span></span>
  <input type="search" class="form-control" placeholder="Filter Messages">
  <span class="form-control-clear glyphicon glyphicon-remove text-muted form-control-feedback hidden"></span>
</div>
