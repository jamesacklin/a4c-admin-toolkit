  Data grids are an alternative to table rows that group pieces of data together with a label. This allows for grouping a custer of data items together into the same cohesive area, and allowing the user to operate on the <em>group</em> of datum. This is particulary useful for nesting inside cards.

  Data grids are built using the semantically awesome description list element (`<dl>`) and its corresponding description term (`<dt>`) and description definition (`<dd>`) tags. Think of the `<dl>` as a sort of key-value pair (grouping element), the `<dt>` as the column header, and the `<dd>` as the cell data.

  Data grids are arranged into a maximum of 4 columns and are customizable by screen size. In the example below, the grid arranges itself into 1 column for extra-small screens, then splits into 2 columns for small screens, 3 columns on medium screens, and 4 columns for large screens.
