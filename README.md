# Apps4Clubz Admin UI Toolkit

This UI toolkit is a highly-modular design system for the [Apps4Clubz](http://www.apps4clubz.com) Admin application. It contains different materials that can be assembled into more complex page layouts. This guide contains real working examples, code snippets, documentation, and style guidelines.

The Apps4Clubz Admin app is based on [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) version 3 (included). All its unique components and styles are extensions of Bootstrap's, which is included in the toolkit CSSâ€”the idea being a developer simply includes the `toolkit.css` and `toolkit.js` files, and they have the entire pattern library at their disposal.

## Quick Start

```shell
$ curl -L https://github.com/jamesacklin/a4c-admin-toolkit/archive/master.tar.gz | tar zx --strip 1
$ npm start
```
